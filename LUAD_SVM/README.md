Data processing and model training (linear SVM) using gene expression and DNA methylation data from healthy and cancerous lung tissue (lung adenocarcinoma; https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-LUAD). 
SVM classifies tissues as healthy (0) or cancerous (1). Sample and direct usage can be done using the links to the colabs. The corresponding notebooks are also provided. Part of a Master's coursework project for BINF7000 at the University of Queensland.
